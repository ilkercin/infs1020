## Welcome to INFS1020 ## 

You can visit the [Sydney Uni INFS1020 website](https://www.sydney.edu.au/courses/units-of-study/2021/infs/infs1020.html) for more details about this course.

Digital technologies, such as social media, mobile devices, and data analytics, have changed the way we collect and present ideas, communicate, and work together. In this unit, students are introduced to various digital work environments and their implications for how work is done. Students learn about how employers recruit graduates online, what it is like to join and work in a modern, digital workplace, and the tensions that arise when traditional, structured workplaces are transformed through digital, flexible, and networked ways of working. Students engage in hands-on activities to acquire skills for how to present themselves effectively and professionally online (personal branding), how to communicate in digital channels in an organisational context (professional communication), how to effectively search for and work with digital information (data literacy), and how to digitally coordinate work in teams.
